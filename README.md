### How To Play

City Building Similuator

HOW TO PLAY:
Arrow Keys to move the cursor around
z (A) to select a human
X (B) to open building menu
A (X) to go back

The Goal is to Advance to end of level 3 (the blue bar) with as many sets of four colors as possible (one of each). Each human will have a different color assigned to them.

By building blue schools, you can increase the speed of advancement. Gold Mines will increase your gold production rate.

The population will increase over time and people need more food, causing your hunger bar (green) to decrease more rapidly. If your hunger bar drops to zero, three random citizens will be eaten.

You can build green houses to prevent that. Or... you can sacrifice your citizens for food.

Which citizen is most valuable to you, make your choice.

### Bugs found

Game will crash after the game.
When too many people on field game board gets confused and new citizens will spawn as blue boxes
